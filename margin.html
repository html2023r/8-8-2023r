A paragraph is defined as “a group of sentences or a 
single sentence that forms a unit” (Lunsford and Connors 116). 
Length and appearance do not determine whether a section in a paper is a paragraph.
 For instance, in some styles of writing, particularly journalistic styles
, a paragraph can be just one sentence long.
