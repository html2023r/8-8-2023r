<p>A paragraph is defined as <br>“a group of sentences or a 
single sentence that forms a <br>unit” (Lunsford and Connors 116). 
Length and appearance do not determine <br>whether a section in a paper is a paragraph.
 For instance, in some styles of writing, p<br>articularly journalistic styles
, a<p> paragraph can be just one<br> sentence long.
