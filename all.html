<dt> <h1 align = center>What is Trignometry</h1>
<dd>Trigonometry (from Ancient Greek τρίγωνον (trígōnon) 'triangle', and μέτρον (métron) 'measure')[1] 
is a branch of mathematics concerned with relationships between angles and ratios of lengths. The field 
emerged in the Hellenistic world during the 3rd century BC from applications of geometry to astronomical
 studies.[2] The Greeks focused on the calculation of chords, while mathematicians in India created
 the earliest-known tables of values for trigonometric ratios (also called trigonometric functions)
 such as sine.[3]
<p>Throughout history, trigonometry has been applied in areas such as geodesy, 
surveying, celestial mechanics, and navigation.[4]
<p>Trigonometry is known for its many identities. These trigonometric 
identities[5][6] are commonly used for rewriting trigonometrical expressions 
with the aim to simplify an expression, to find a more useful form of an expression, 
or to solve an equation.[7]</dl>

<dt> <h2 align = center>History of Trignometry</h2>
<dd>Sumerian astronomers studied angle measure, using a division of circles into 360 degrees.
They, and later the Babylonians, studied the ratios of the sides of similar triangles and 
discovered some properties of these ratios but did not turn that into a systematic method 
for finding sides and angles of triangles. The ancient Nubians used a similar method.
<p>In the 3rd century BC, Hellenistic mathematicians such as Euclid and Archimedes studied 
the properties of chords and inscribed angles in circles, and they proved theorems that are 
equivalent to modern trigonometric formulae, although they presented them geometrically rather
 than algebraically. In 140 BC, Hipparchus (from Nicaea, Asia Minor) gave the first tables of
 chords, analogous to modern tables of sine values, and used them to solve problems in trigonometry
 and spherical trigonometry.[11] In the 2nd century AD, the Greco-Egyptian astronomer Ptolemy 
(from Alexandria, Egypt) constructed detailed trigonometric tables (Ptolemy's table of chords) 
in Book 1, chapter 11 of his Almagest.[12] Ptolemy used chord length to define his trigonometric 
functions, a minor difference from the sine convention we use today.[13] (The value we call sin(θ)
 can be found by looking up the chord length for twice the angle of interest (2θ) in Ptolemy's 
table, and then dividing that value by two.) Centuries passed before more detailed tables were 
produced, and Ptolemy's treatise remained in use for performing trigonometric calculations in 
astronomy throughout the next 1200 years in the medieval Byzantine, Islamic, and, later, Western 
European worlds.
<p>The modern sine convention is first attested in the Surya Siddhanta, and its properties were 
further documented by the 5th century (AD) Indian mathematician and astronomer Aryabhata.[14] 
These Greek and Indian works were translated and expanded by medieval Islamic mathematicians. 
In 830 AD, Persian mathematician Habash al-Hasib al-Marwazi produced the first table of cotangents.
[15][16] By the 10th century AD, in the work of Persian mathematician Abū al-Wafā' al-Būzjānī, all 
six trigonometric functions were used.[17] Abu al-Wafa had sine tables in 0.25° increments, to 8 
decimal places of accuracy, and accurate tables of tangent values.[17] He also made important 
innovations in spherical trigonometry[18][19][20] The Persian polymath Nasir al-Din al-Tusi has 
been described as the creator of trigonometry as a mathematical discipline in its own right.[21]
[22][23] He was the first to treat trigonometry as a mathematical discipline independent from astronomy,
 and he developed spherical trigonometry into its present form.[16] He listed the six distinct 
cases of a right-angled triangle in spherical trigonometry, and in his On the Sector Figure, he 
stated the law of sines for plane and spherical triangles, discovered the law of tangents for 
spherical triangles, and provided proofs for both these laws.[24] Knowledge of trigonometric 
functions and methods reached Western Europe via Latin translations of Ptolemy's Greek 
Almagest as well as the works of Persian and Arab astronomers such as Al Battani and 
Nasir al-Din al-Tusi.[25] One of the earliest works on trigonometry by a northern European 
mathematician is De Triangulis by the 15th century German mathematician Regiomontanus, who was 
encouraged to write, and provided with a copy of the Almagest, by the Byzantine Greek scholar 
cardinal Basilios Bessarion with whom he lived for several years.[26] At the same time, another 
translation of the Almagest from Greek into Latin was completed by the Cretan George of Trebizond.
[27] Trigonometry was still so little known in 16th-century northern Europe that Nicolaus Copernicus 
devoted two chapters of De revolutionibus orbium coelestium to explain its basic concepts.

Driven by the demands of navigation and the growing need for accurate maps of large geographic areas, trigonometry grew into a major branch of mathematics.[28] Bartholomaeus Pitiscus was the first to use the word, publishing his Trigonometria in 1595.[29] Gemma Frisius described for the first time the method of triangulation still used today in surveying. It was Leonhard Euler who fully incorporated complex numbers into trigonometry. The works of the Scottish mathematicians James Gregory in the 17th century and Colin Maclaurin in the 18th century were influential in the development of trigonometric series.[30] Also in the 18th century, Brook Taylor defined the general Taylor series.[31]
